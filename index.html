        As part of my journey through Praxis, I’ve taken time to reflect on how I define engineering, design, and engineering design—and how these definitions have evolved through experience. These reflections help me better understand the role of empathy, iteration, and stakeholder awareness in shaping practical and meaningful solutions.

      <h2 style="color: #000;">Reflections</h2>

      <p><strong>Engineering is:</strong><br>
        <span>
          The process of creating a product that is beneficial to a group of stakeholders and has undergone thought. This entails that iterations have gone through when constructing the product and several different perspectives have gone into creating a solution.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Why I think this is:</strong><br>
        <span>
          I think this is the case because as an engineer we have to make decisions that will create the best possible solution to resolve the problem/opportunity. This primarily relies on the product's ability to function and solve the problem, rather than working to make it easy for a consumer.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design is:</strong><br>
        <span>
          The process of creating a product that is either aesthetically pleasing for a consumer or that is the most user-friendly (usable). This entails that the design is able to successfully achieve the desired use as easily as possible.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Why I think this:</strong><br>
        <span>
          I think this is the case because it is important that when creating designs we need to put thought into whether this is appealing for a consumer to purchase and whether or not it can be applied in the real world.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Engineering Design is:</strong><br>
        <span>
          A combination of both engineering and design where you have to create a product that is both applicable to solve the intended problem as efficiently as possible and able to appeal to the stakeholders as usable and aesthetically pleasing.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Why I think this:</strong><br>
        <span>
          I think this is the case because as an engineering student I feel that when making decisions we have to be conscious of the various different DFx’s and when creating a design this can impact and change our design. This is prominent as when creating products to resolve issues we can find ourselves to be too focused on a particular aspect ruining the effectiveness of others. Hence why an important design which can still encompass and is more versatile for the user will be preferred.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p><strong>How did your understanding of framing or other Praxis models inform your engagement with the RFP?</strong><br>
        <span>
          Throughout Praxis my thought process when working towards engineering design has changed as I have become much more conscious of constantly addressing the stakeholders' needs. Now as I begin to work with a real client rather than a “Splartz” I have become aware of communicating with clients and working towards a solution. Despite my own RFP not moving forward I understood how to converse with a community in a manner where they did not feel threatened or forced to commit to anything while still being able to get valuable information. Now as I begin to reframe the selected RFP I see the importance in each step along the journey and how crucial it is to address stakeholder needs.
